Reversed: lack of collaboration, no motivation, few goals, misalignment, little growth
General: If you are familiar with pentacles, then you already know that this suit is usually associated with security and growth in many different areas.

You are competent at what you do, and you are making progress. However, just like the Stoneman and the architects couldn’t build the cathedral on their own, the Three of Pentacles card can also be a sign to collaborate with others.

Just like the laborer you are working hard to improve your skills and reach a new level of mastery.
